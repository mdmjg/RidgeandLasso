# ### 3.1 Experiments with the shooting algorithm

# 3.1.1 The algorithm as described above is not ready for a large dataset (at least if it has being implemented in Python) because of the implied loop in the summation signs for the expressions
# for aj and cj . Give an expression for computing aj and cj using matrix and vector operations,
# without explicit loops. This is called âvectorizationâ and can lead to dramatic speedup when
# implemented in languages such as Python, Matlab, and R. Write your expressions using X,
# w, y = (y1, . . . , yn)
# T
# (the column vector of responses), XÂ·j (the jth column of X, represented
# as a column matrix), and wj (the jth coordinate of w â a scalar).

#  $$a_{j} = 2|X_j|^{2}$$

# $$c_{j} = 2*X_j(y-w^{T}X + w_{j}X_{j})$$

# ### 3.1.2 Write a function that computes the Lasso solution for a given Î» using the shooting algorithm described above. 
# For convergence criteria, continue coordinate descent until a pass through
# the coordinates reduces the objective function by less than 10â8, or you have taken 1000 passes through the coordinates. Compare performance of cyclic coordinate descent to
# randomized coordinate descent, where in each round we pass through the coordinates in a
# different random order (for your choices of Î»). Compare also the solutions attained
# (following the convergence criteria above) for starting at 0 versus starting at the ridge
# regression solution suggested by Murphy (again, for your choices of Î»). If you like, you may
# adjust the convergence criteria to try to attain better results (or the same results faster).

# ### 4.1 
# The performance of the Shooting Algorithm seems to be best. It has a lower mean Squared Error. 

# ### 4.2
# We can see that the Projected SGD via variable splitting method has greater sparcity because the graph has less peaks, suggesting less effects from the weights. More weights would cause the graph to have greater, more constant changes.
